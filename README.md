[Comparing Vue and React in 2023: Pros and Cons](https://dev.to/ptheodosiou/comparing-vue-and-react-in-2023-pros-and-cons-10nl#:~:text=Vue%20and%20React%20are%20still%20popular%20web%20development%20frameworks%20in,personal%20experience%20with%20the%20frameworks.)

### Pros

* **Easy to Learn and Use:** Vue offers a smooth learning curve that makes it suitable for both novice and professional developers.

* **High Performance:** Vue's virtual DOM and efficient rendering result in speedy and performant apps.

* **Flexible and Incremental Adoption:** Vue enables progressive adoption in existing projects, making it adaptable to a variety of use cases.

* **Composition API:** Vue's Composition API allows you to handle state and logic in components in a modular and flexible manner, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

* **Strong Ecosystem:** Vue has a growing ecosystem of libraries, tools, and plugins that are backed up by excellent documentation and a welcoming community.

### Cons

* **Smaller Community:** Vue's community is still smaller than React's, making it more difficult to find extensive resources and support.

* **Limited Enterprise Adoption:** When compared to React, which has a longer history and established presence in the enterprise space, Vue may have limited adoption in large-scale enterprise applications.

The share of Vue.js users grew from 34% in 2020 to 43% in 2021 while React experienced a drop from 64% to 49% in a YoY comparison. 

### Documentation
"Since Vue has a very active community, there’s a plethora of well-maintained and organized documentation. This makes it easier to learn and find solutions to issues you could encounter. Actually, 76% of Vue survey participants pointed to great documentation as the biggest advantage of the framework. The overhauled documentation has been one of the core updates in Vue 3."


# Systems Requirements

* By default, Vue uses HTML templates, but there’s an option to write in JSX.

"Vue is lightweight, easy to learn, pleasant to write in, and not difficult to integrate with legacy technologies or an application without a specified framework.  Because of its familiar templating syntax and use of components, integrating or migrating existing projects to Vue is faster and smoother. For that reason, Vue.js is great for startups but can be just as well used in large-scale applications."
